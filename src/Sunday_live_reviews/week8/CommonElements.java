CommonElements [multidimensional, loop]

	Create a program that will define a 2D int array with some numbers. Go through and find which elements can be found in all of the inner arrays

	Ex:
	       int[][] arr {
	              {4, 1, 24, 5},
	              {24, 1, 5, 2},
	              {4, 1, 5, 1}
	       }

	       common elements are: 1, 5

	       -> 4 is missing from the 2nd array & 24 is missing from the 3rd array so those aren't common elements
